# Tests

There is a one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:

```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.

```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.

```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.
