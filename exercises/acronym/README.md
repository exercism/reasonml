# Acronym

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

## Building and testing
You will need the node package manager (npm) installed - download from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
There is one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:
```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.
```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.
```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.
# Editor
If you use `vscode`, Press `Windows + Shift + B` it will build automatically
