# Anagram

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Building and testing
You will need the node package manager (npm) installed - download from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
There is one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:
```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.
```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.
```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.
