# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Building and testing
You will need the node package manager (npm) installed - download from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
There is one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:
```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.
```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.
```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.
