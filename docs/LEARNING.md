# Learning

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Reason for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

[ReScript home page](https://rescript-lang.org/)
[Programmer blog](https://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/learning-reasonml-part-1/)

ReScript can use [Belt](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Belt.html) the standard library shipped with Bucklescript (the underlying Ocaml system which it overlays).
